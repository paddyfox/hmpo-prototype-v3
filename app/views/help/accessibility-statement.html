    <h2>Technical information about this website's accessibility<h2>
    <p>Her Majesty’s Passport Office is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.<p>

    <h2>Compliance status<h2>
    <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a id="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1" href=https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/ target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

    <h2>Non-accessible content<h2>
    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.<p>

    <h3>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations<h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>The 'Upload your photo' heading and button are confusing when viewed with a screen reader. This fails WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A), 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A) and WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA).</li>
        <li>Users are not warned of the duration in which activity will result in their session expiring and not given the opportunity to extend their session before it expires. This fails WCAG 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (A).</li>
        <li>When users upload a photo, the ‘Uploading image’ and ‘Processing image’ progress element does not include an accessible name. This means some users of assistive technology may be unable to determine progress on the processing of the image. This fails WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A).</li>
        <li>The ‘Upload your photo’, ‘Uploading image’ and ‘Processing image’ pages do not contain a level-one heading that is visible to screen reader users. This means users may not be able to determine the structure of content on the page. This fails WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A).</li>
        <li>In some pages where there is a summary list, some definition list items are not wrapped in parent elements. This means assistive technologies will not read the list correctly. This fails WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A).</li>
        <li>In some pages, screen reader users find the general navigation difficult due to non-descriptive page titles and heading structures. This means users are unable to accurately determine the topic or purpose of some pages. This fails WCAG 2.4.2 Page Titled (A).</li>
        <li>On the ‘Choose a date and place’ page, the service uses tables to present timeslots for users. The ‘Earlier’ and ‘Later’ links related to the table is not descriptive enough for users to determine its destination or purpose. This fails WCAG 2.4.4 Link Purpose (A).</li>
        <li>Some validation error messages are not descriptive enough. This means screen readers are not able to differentiate between them. This fails WCAG 2.4.4 Link Purpose (A).</li>
        <li>Some image icons do not include alternative text elements. This means screen readers may be unable to determine the elements content or purpose. This fails WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text Content (A).</li>
        <li>On the ‘You need a new photo’ tracking page, the image icons receive keyboard focus, but focus becomes trapped.  This means some keyboard users may be unable to navigate the main content of the page. This fails WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (A).</li>
        <li>On the first page, users applying on behalf of an adult or child are warned to 'answer questions with their details rather than your own'. This is not repeated throughout the service, which means some users may not know whose information to provide. This fails WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (AA).</li>
        <li>On the page where users are asked 'Which is your passport issuing authority' the  acronyms are not expanded. This means users may not understand the acronym's purpose or meaning. This fails WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (AA).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disproportionate burden<h2>
    <p>At this time, we have not made any disproportionate burden claims.<p>

    <h2>Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations<h2>
    <p>PDFs and other documents. Some of our PDFs are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs that users can use to confirm their identity or provide proof of payment. We plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages. Any new PDFs we publish will meet accessibility standards.<p>

    <h2>What we’re doing to improve accessibility<h2>
    <p>We will fix issues that fail to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard. We will update this page when issues are fixed.<p>

    <h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement<h2>
    <p>This statement was prepared on 23 September 2020.<p>
    <p>It was last reviewed on 24 June 2021.<p>
    <p>This website was last tested on 26 February 2021 and was checked for compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1. Testing was carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.<p>
